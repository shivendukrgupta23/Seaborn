 Seaborn Practice Repository

This repository is a learning project where I practiced data visualization with Seaborn, one of Python’s most powerful libraries for statistical graphics.

Through these examples, I built a strong understanding of how to use plots to explore data, highlight patterns, and tell stories visually.

What I Learned

✅ How to create and customize plots with Seaborn

✅ How Seaborn works with Matplotlib & Pandas

✅ How to visualize distributions, relationships, and categories

✅ How to make plots more informative and attractive with styling.

📊 Visualizations in This Repo

This repo covers almost all major Seaborn plots:

🟦 Bar Plot – Compare categories

📦 Box Plot – Show spread & outliers

🔢 Count Plot – Frequency of categories

🧩 Catplot – Categorical visualization at scale

🔥 Heatmap – Highlight correlations

📉 Histogram – Distribution of values

📈 Line Plot – Trend over time

🌐 Pair Plot – Relationships across variables

⚪ Scatter Plot – Compare two variables

🎻 Violin Plot – Distribution + density in one

🎯 Strip Plot – Categorical scatterplot

Each script is standalone — run one file, get one type of plot. Simple and focused.
